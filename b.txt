I define a recursive CTE paths(src, tgt) that starts from all links whose source is 'home'.
The recursive step joins paths.tgt to PageLinks.source so we keep following links outward from any page reached so far, collecting all reachable targets.
In the final query I select distinct tgt values (renamed reachable_page) where the page name matches the regex '(ref|polic)' with ~* for case-insensitive matching, and order the result alphabetically.
